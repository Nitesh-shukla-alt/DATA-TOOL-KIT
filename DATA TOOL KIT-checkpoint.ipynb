    "\"\"\" Q1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational package for scientific computing in Python. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "An ndarray object for efficient, homogeneous, multi­dimensional arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorized operations, broadcasting rules, and element­-wise calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "A rich collection of mathematical functions (linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random simulations)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NumPy arrays reside in contiguous memory, support fast C-level loops, and integrate seamlessly with other scientific libraries (SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn), they deliver dramatic performance gains over pure Python lists for numerical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
    "Broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "If dimensions differ, NumPy “stretches” the smaller array along the dimension of size 1 so that both operands have compatible shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "Two dimensions are compatible when they are equal or one of them is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing dimensions are implicitly treated as size 1 on the left\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:   \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "              [4, 5, 6]])    # shape (2, 3)\n",
    "b = np.array([10, 20, 30])   # shape   (3,)\n",
    "c = a + b                    # b is broadcast to [[10,20,30],\n",

    "\"\"\"  Q3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
    "A Pandas DataFrame is a two­dimensional, size­-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).\n",

    "Each column is a Series sharing the same index\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports automatic alignment, missing data handling, and heterogeneous dtypes\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas?\n",

    "\n",
    "Split the data into groups based on one or more keys (columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply an aggregation, transformation, or filtering function to each group independently\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine the results into a new DataFrame or Series\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",

    "\n",
    "Python lists can contain mixed types\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",

    "\n",
    "Ideal for visualizing large, dense tables of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlights patterns, correlations, clusters, or outliers at a glance\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",
    "Vectorized operations refer to applying arithmetic or boolean operations directly to entire arrays without explicit Python loops. Behind the scenes, NumPy dispatches to optimized C code that processes all elements in a compiled loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leads to concise code in idiomatic mathematical notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizes Python interpreter overhead\n",
    "\n",
